## üìà Market Economics

### Betting Mechanics
- **Pari-mutuel betting**: Winners split the losing side's pool
- **Proportional payouts**: Based on bet size and odds
- **Platform fee**: 2.5% on winnings
- **Gas fees**: Standard Ethereum transaction costs

### Example Payout Calculation
```
Total Pool: 100 ETH
Yes Bets: 30 ETH
No Bets: 70 ETH
Correct Outcome: Yes
Platform Fee: 2.5%

Payout Pool = 100 ETH - (100 ETH * 0.025) = 97.5 ETH
User Bet: 5 ETH on Yes
User Share: (5 ETH / 30 ETH) * 97.5 ETH = 16.25 ETH
```

## üîß Development Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run check        # TypeScript type checking
npm run db:push      # Push database schema changes

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start           # Start production server

# Database
npm run db:push      # Apply database migrations
```
